divide_out_of_transit  False         # *experimental*. Whether to divide the in-transit data by median out-of-transit or not. only used if observation is set to transmission.
out_of_transit_dur     1.          # *experimental*. Duration of the out-of-transit data, in units of transit duration. only used if observation is set to transmission and divide_out_of_transit is set to True.
