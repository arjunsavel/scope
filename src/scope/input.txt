# Instrument Parameters
blaze                  True          # whether to include a blaze function or not.

# Observation Parameters
observation            transmission      # type of observation to perform. supported observations are ``emission`` and ``transmission``.
phase_start            -0.011464100685159746           # phase of the beginning of the observations. 0 is center of transit, 0.5 is secondary eclipse.

n_exposures            10             # number of exposures to simulate. sets the phases of the exposures.
star                   True          # whether to include the star in the simulation. In general, you'd like to!
telluric               True          # whether to include tellurics in the simulation. In general, you'd like to!
SNR                    110           # signal-to-noise ratio of the observations, per pixel. I.e., what sets the photon counts at the detector.
tell_type              data-driven   # type of telluric simulation. supported modes are ``ATRAN`` and ``data-driven``.
time_dep_tell          False         # whether the tellurics are time-dependent or not.

# Analysis Parameters
n_princ_comp           4             # number of principal components to remove from the simulated data before cross-correlation.
